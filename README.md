Metadata Editor

Metadata Editor is a Python Tkinter GUI tool for inspecting and editing strings in binary and metadata files. It automatically extracts ASCII and UTF-16 strings, shows their offsets and lengths, and lets you search, filter, and modify them. All changes can be saved back safely. Ideal for reverse engineering, modding, and exploring file data.

Features:

Load binaries, executables, DLLs, and raw data files

Extract and display ASCII and UTF-16 strings with offsets

Search, filter by length, and view only modified strings

Hex preview mode for low-level inspection

Edit strings safely with warnings for length changes

Pattern extraction for integers/floats and basic data-type analysis
