# Metadata Editor

**Metadata Editor** is a Python Tkinter GUI tool for inspecting and editing strings in binary and metadata files. It automatically extracts ASCII and UTF-16 strings, shows their offsets and lengths, and lets you search, filter, and modify them. All changes can be saved back safely. Ideal for reverse engineering, modding, and exploring file data.

**Features:**

* Load binaries, executables, DLLs, and raw data files
* Extract and display ASCII and UTF-16 strings with offsets
* Search, filter by length, and view only modified strings
* Hex preview mode for low-level inspection
* Edit strings safely with warnings for length changes
* Pattern extraction for integers/floats and basic data-type analysis
